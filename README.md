  # Description
  üìù Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this application, my challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
